## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond common Python libaries.  The code should run with no issues using Python version 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using AirBnB Seattle data from 2016 to better understand:

1. How the price of available listings is behaving over the months?
2. Which variable affect the price of available listings?
3. Is it possible to predict the price of new listings based on the selected variable in 2.?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by AirBnB, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here: #Insert link to blog post


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Within this notebook the necessary steps to create answers to the above questions are executed. By comments one should be able to follow the think process behind the individual commands.  

Additionally there is a folder containing the raw data files from AirBnB.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](#Link to Blogpost).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBnB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like! I also want to thank Udacity for the great introduction!
